MVC (module, view, controller) architecture in a nutshell
 
 Module layer: application's data and business logic
    
 Controller layer: application's request, interact with modules and send back responses

 View layer: only necessary if we have a grafical interface, in other words, a server-side rendered website. It's basically the template shown

Application logic: 
 -Code focused on the app's implementation, which makes it work
 -Concerned about managing requests and responses
 -A bridge for module-view layers

Business logic:
 -Code that is focused on solving business problem we set out to solve
 -Focused on the business needs itself.

Fat models/thin controllers philosofy: Put all logic in the models and keep controllers as simple as possible
